description: A biography of Theodore Roosevelt (1858-1919), as an individual person
  and as the 26th president of the United States between 1901-1909. He was a son of
  Theodore Roosevelt and Martha Bulloch, and he married Edith Carow. The author (a
  friend but not a political follower) felt that President Roosevelt's principal contribution
  to the nation was in social welfare legislature, through "... beginning and carrying
  forward the war for the reconciliation between Capital and Labor ... Does any one
  now defend selling liquor to children ... Does any one defend sweat-shops, or the
  manufacture of cigars under worse than unsanitary conditions? Which of the packers
  who protested against the Meat Inspection Bill, would care to have his name made
  public; and which of the lawyers and of the accomplices in the lobby and in Congress
  would care to have it known that he used every means, fair and foul, to prevent
  depriving the packers of the privilege of canning bad meat for Americans, although
  foreigners insisted that the canned meat which they bought should be wholesome and
  inspected? Does any American now doubt the wisdom and justice of conserving the
  natural resources, of saving our forests and our mineral supplies, and of controlling
  the watershed from which flows the water-supply of of entires States?"--P.ix-xi.
